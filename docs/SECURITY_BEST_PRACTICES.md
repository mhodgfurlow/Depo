# Depo - Security Best Practices

## Overview

Security is critical in any application, especially when dealing with sensitive data like private keys, wallet addresses, and API keys. This document outlines best practices for securing **Depo**.

## 1. Secure API Routes

### Use Authentication

- Use **JWT** (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication and authorization.
- Implement **OAuth** or other secure login mechanisms for external integrations like **GitHub**.

### HTTPS

- Ensure all communications between the frontend and backend are done over **HTTPS**.
- Enable **SSL/TLS** encryption to protect data in transit.

---

## 2. Protecting Private Keys

### Environment Variables

- Store **private keys** and sensitive data like **SendGrid API keys** in environment variables.
- Never hardcode private keys or other sensitive information in source code.

```bash
# .env
SOLANA_SECRET_KEY=your_private_key
SENDGRID_API_KEY=your_sendgrid_key
```

### Secrets Management

- Use **AWS Secrets Manager**, **HashiCorp Vault**, or similar tools to securely store and manage sensitive data in production environments.

---

## 3. Secure Database Access

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

- Use **RBAC** to limit access to sensitive data based on the user's role. For example, only authorized administrators should be able to access user data or modify the contract state.

### Use Strong Database Credentials

- Always use **strong, unique credentials** for accessing databases.
- Use **SSH tunneling** or **VPNs** to restrict access to databases from trusted IPs.

---

## 4. Monitor and Log Activities

### Use Logging

- Implement logging for all backend activities, including user authentication attempts, API requests, and interactions with the blockchain.
- Ensure logs are securely stored and can be monitored in real time for suspicious activity.

### Enable Alerts

- Set up **alerts** for suspicious activities such as multiple failed login attempts or unusual API usage patterns.

---

## 5. Code Security

### Use Linter and Static Analysis

- Use **linters** and **static analysis tools** to catch potential security vulnerabilities during development.
- Tools like **ESLint**, **Prettier**, and **SonarQube** can help detect insecure coding practices.

### Dependency Management

- Regularly update **dependencies** to ensure the project is protected from known vulnerabilities.
- Use tools like **npm audit** or **Snyk** to check for outdated or vulnerable dependencies.

---

## 6. Secure Solana Blockchain Interactions

### Private Key Management

- Keep **Solana private keys** secure and never expose them in the frontend or public repositories.
- Use secure methods like **hardware wallets** or **environment variables** for managing Solana private keys.

### Network Security

- Always interact with the **Solana blockchain** over a secure connection (`https://api.devnet.solana.com` or similar endpoints).
- Avoid using public nodes that could compromise the security of your transactions.

---

## 7. Conclusion

Securing the **Depo** platform requires careful handling of private keys, sensitive data, and monitoring of all interactions. By following the above best practices, you can reduce the risk of security breaches and ensure that user data and transactions are protected.
