# Depo 🚀

**Depo** is a platform that integrates **Solana blockchain** for **token minting** and features a **waitlist system** for users to join and mint tokens. Built with **React** on the frontend and **Node.js/Express** on the backend, **Depo** allows seamless interaction with the blockchain, offering an intuitive user interface and robust backend functionality.

## Why **Depo**? 🤔

The **Depo** project was created to bridge the gap between blockchain technology and everyday users, making it easier for people to interact with the **Solana blockchain** without needing deep technical knowledge. The goal is to provide a simple and effective platform where users can mint tokens and join a waitlist, all while leveraging the power of blockchain technology for faster and more secure transactions.

With the explosive growth of **Solana** and the increasing interest in **decentralized applications (dApps)**, **Depo** aims to provide a user-friendly interface to integrate blockchain functionality into real-world use cases. By combining a simple waitlist system with token minting, **Depo** offers an accessible entry point into the world of cryptocurrencies and decentralized applications.
